# Vaccine Booking App

[Demo](https://demo-vaccine-center.netlify.app/)

To get you quickly started on the challenge, we have created this boilerplate as a guideline

This project was bootstrapped with 
- [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
- [Material UI](https://mui.com/)

You can read the specific Create React App Read me at `CRA-README.md`

# What you need to do
## If using this boilerplate
- Read the code
- The code only contain simple logic to display data on the UI, nothing beyond that.
- Backend code not included, you will have to provide this
- You need to fill up the code invoke API calls that you will build

## If you don't wish to use this boilerplate
Yes, you can choose build your own ui, but we typically find that people spend too much time on these stuff, and we want you to focus on building the important and complicated things

If you still choose to go ahead, you can simply ignore the rest of the readme here

# Available Routes
`/bookings` - List all the booking in a table

`/bookings/:bookingId` - Update page of the booking

`/` - Create a new Booking

# Containers
## EditVaccineRegistration
Dummy UI with prepopulated data, your main aim is to fill up this with real data from (hopefully) your db, and implement a update API call
## VaccineRegistrationListing
A table of all the bookings, including two links to update and delete bookings, your main aim is to fill this up with real data, and implement your delete API call
## VaccineRegistration
Dummy UI to accept data from the users, your main aim here is to call the Create booking API

# What you should do
Git clone this project, don't fork it.
If you are submitting the challenge using this boilerplate via github follow the instruction [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/duplicating-a-repository)

# What you can do
Change any UI code as you like.
- one more button? 
- one more field?
- don't like the color of the table?
- want more page?
- want to use Redux?

Go ahead, we are not stopping you.

# All the best in completing the Challenge!
